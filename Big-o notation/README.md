## What is Big O Notation?
Big O notation describes the time complexity (execution time) and space complexity (memory usage) of an algorithm as the input size grows. 
It helps us compare different algorithms and choose the most efficient one.


## How to Identify Big O Complexity?
- Loops?
Single loop → O(n)
Nested loop → O(n²)

- Recursion?
Fibonacci → O(2ⁿ)
Divide & conquer → O(log n)

- Sorting?
Bubble Sort → O(n²)
Merge Sort → O(n log n)

- Having the problem each time?
Binary Search → O(log n)
