# 🚀 DSA Notes & Problem Solving  

Welcome to the **DSA Problem Solving** repository! 🎯  
This repo documents my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) learning journey**

## 📖 Topics Covered (Ongoing)  
I'll keep updating this section as I learn new concepts! 🚀  

✅ **Day 1**  
🔹 **What Are Data Structures? Why Use Them? ADT**  
🔹 **Big O Notation & Time Complexity**  

---

## 📌 What is a Data Structure?  
A **data structure** is a way to **store and organize data** in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.  

### 🎯 **Why Do We Need Data Structures?**  
✅ Essential for creating **fast and optimized** algorithms  
✅ Helps manage & organize data efficiently  
✅ Makes code **cleaner & easier to understand**

## 📌 Abstract Data Types (ADT)  
An **Abstract Data Type (ADT)** is an **abstraction** of a data structure that provides only the **interface**, without specifying the underlying implementation.  

### 🔹 **Common ADTs and Their Use Cases**  
| ADT               | Concept                           | Example Uses                         |
|-------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **List**         | Ordered collection              | Arrays, Linked Lists                |
| **Stack**        | LIFO (Last In, First Out)       | Undo/Redo, Function Calls           |
| **Queue**        | FIFO (First In, First Out)      | Print Jobs, Task Scheduling         |
| **Deque**        | Add/Remove from both ends      | Browser History                     |
| **Priority Queue** | Elements removed by priority | Dijkstra’s Algorithm                |
| **Map (Dictionary)** | Key-value pair storage    | C++ Map, Python Dict                |
| **Graph**        | Nodes & Edges                   | Social Networks, Navigation         |

### 🎯 **Why Are ADTs Important?**  
✅ Helps in choosing the **right data structure** for a given problem  
✅ Allows **separation of logic from implementation** (e.g., using a stack without caring about its underlying implementation)  
✅ Makes **algorithms more efficient and modular**

## 📌 Computational Complexity Analysis  
Understanding the **efficiency** of an algorithm in terms of **time** & **space** is crucial in DSA.  

### 🔹 **Key Questions**  
🔹 **How much time does an algorithm take to complete?**  
🔹 **How much space does an algorithm need?**  

### 🔹 **Types of Complexity**  
1️⃣ **Time Complexity** ⏳ – How runtime grows with input size (`n`).  
2️⃣ **Space Complexity** 💾 – How memory usage grows with input size.
