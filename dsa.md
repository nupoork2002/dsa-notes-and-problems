## What is Data Structure

- A data Structure is away to store and organize data in computer,  so that it can be used efficently

## Why Data Structure

- Essential for creating fast and powerful algorithm
- Help to manage and organize data
- Make code  cleaner & easier to understand

 ## Abstract Data Type 

 - An abstract data type(ADT) is abstraction of data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to.

 | ADT               | Concept                           | Example Uses                         |
|-------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **List**         | Ordered collection              | Arrays, Linked Lists                |
| **Stack**        | LIFO (Last In, First Out)       | Undo/Redo, Function Calls           |
| **Queue**        | FIFO (First In, First Out)      | Print Jobs, Task Scheduling         |
| **Deque**        | Add/Remove from both ends      | Browser History                     |
| **Priority Queue** | Elements removed by priority | Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm                |
| **Map (Dictionary)** | Key-value pair storage    | C++ Map, Python Dict                |
| **Graph**        | Nodes & Edges                   | Social Networks, Navigation         |
  
## Why are ADTs ?

- ADTs help in choosing the right data structure for a given problem.
- They allow us to separate logic from implementation (Example: We use stack without caring if it's implemented with an array or linked list).
- They make algorithms more efficient and modular.

## Computational Complexity Analysis 

- How much does this algorithm need to finish
- How much space this algo need for computation
  
## **Types of Complexity**
1. **Time Complexity** ‚è≥ ‚Äì How runtime grows with input size (`n`).
2. **Space Complexity** üíæ ‚Äì How memory usage grows with input size.
